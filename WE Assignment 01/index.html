            <h2>Artificial Intelligence: A Brief Overview</h2>
            <h3>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h3>
            <p>
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. AI systems are designed to analyze data, learn from patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention. The goal of AI is to develop machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving, reasoning, understanding natural language, and adapting to new situations. AI technologies encompass various subfields, including machine learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, robotics, and expert systems.
            </p>
        
            <h3>Types of AI</h3>
            <p>
                There are two primary types of AI: Narrow AI and General AI. Narrow AI, also known as Weak AI, is designed to perform specific tasks and functions within a limited domain. Examples of narrow AI applications include speech recognition systems like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa, recommendation algorithms used by Netflix and Amazon, and autonomous vehicles developed by companies like Tesla and Waymo. In contrast, General AI, also referred to as Strong AI or AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), is a theoretical concept representing machines with human-like intelligence capable of understanding and learning any intellectual task that a human being can. Achieving General AI remains a long-term goal and is an active area of research in the field of artificial intelligence.

            <h3>Applications of AI</h3>
            <p>
                AI technologies have diverse applications across various industries and domains, transforming how businesses operate and improving efficiency and productivity. In healthcare, AI is used for medical image analysis, drug discovery, personalized medicine, and virtual health assistants. Financial institutions leverage AI for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, customer service chatbots, and credit scoring. AI-driven recommendation systems power content curation on platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Amazon. In manufacturing, AI-enabled robots automate repetitive tasks and enhance production processes. AI is also integral to the development of autonomous vehicles, smart cities, and smart homes. As AI continues to advance, its impact on society will grow, presenting new opportunities and challenges in areas such as ethics, privacy, and job displacement.
